# Standup pivots
## Why?
Back when we were physically in the same office, two people (used to be called pivots) would host
the daily standup meeting.

Now that we work in a distributed setting, it's difficult to nominate people in person.

## What is this?
Every week on a Thursday afternoon, this script selects two people at random and nominates them.
It writes the nominations to a Slack channel.

## Now what?
Every Thursday two people learn they are responsible for hosting the following week's standup meetings.
This gives them time to rearrange their schedules or defer hosting duties to someone else.
